TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

 - Copy the IMS folder from 'htdocs' into the 'htdocs' folder in your XAMPP directory.
 - Before opening index.html, go to phpmyadmin and create a new database and name it "test" (make sure to delete or rename any other DBs with the same name).
 - Navigate to the 'import' tab and click on 'Choose File' then select the test.sql file inside the data/test directory in the project_IMS folder.
 - Leave all options as default and click on 'Go' and wait for the DB to be imported.
 - Once the DB 'test' is imported, the application can be used by opening "http://localhost/IMS/index.html" in the browser with XAMPP running.
